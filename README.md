# Scrape App for MacOS ðŸ‘¾

Web scraping app made with pygame. At the moment, it's only a prospect app that will scrape companies from hitta.se and save to csv with few filter possibilities. Faster and easier to make prospect lists instead of copy and paste by yourself.

### Things to do / In progress

- [ ] Add game(s) to play while waiting for scraping to finnish
- [ ] Add allabolag.se for web scraping 
- [ ] Add eniro.se for web scraping
